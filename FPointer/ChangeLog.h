    1.2     18/Jan/2011
            Added some additional documentation.
            
    1.1     18/Jan/2011
            Fixed the date in the copyright.
            Fixed some typos.
            Added the uint32_t call(void); method to allow simple calling the
            calback without passing an argument. The callback function itself
            still has to have a prototype uint32_t callback(uint32_t).

    1.0     18/Jan/2011
            Initial release
